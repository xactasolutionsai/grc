# Workpapers & Evidence Module - Implementation Summary

## Overview

A complete **Workpapers & Evidence** module has been successfully implemented according to the approved plan. This module enables audit workpaper management with file uploads, external links, and a three-state approval workflow (collected → reviewed → approved).

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Backend (Django)

**1. New Django App: `backend/workpapers/`**
   - Fully structured Django app following the existing codebase patterns
   - Registered in `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`
   - URL routing configured at `/api/workpapers/`

**2. Database Models**
   - **Workpaper Model** - Main entity with:
     - File upload support (Excel, Word, PDF, images)
     - External link support for cloud documents
     - Metadata fields (title, description, type, tags, version)
     - Workflow fields (status, uploaded_by, reviewer, approver, timestamps)
     - Validation and helper methods

   - **WorkpaperApproval Model** - Approval history tracking:
     - Records all workflow actions
     - Tracks users, timestamps, and comments
     - Provides complete audit trail

**3. API Endpoints (Django REST Framework)**
   - Standard CRUD operations (list, create, read, update, delete)
   - File operations (upload_file, delete_file)
   - Workflow actions:
     - `submit_for_review/` - Submit workpaper for review
     - `review/` - Mark as reviewed
     - `approve/` - Approve with comments
     - `reject/` - Reject with reason

**5. Admin Interface**
   - Django admin registration for both models
   - Custom fieldsets and readonly fields
   - List filters and search
